		<h1>Reasons you should love pizza</h1>
		<h3><strong>1. There are so many different types</strong></h3>
		<h4>You can get thin crust, Chicago style, meat lovers, vegetarian or classic cheese. There are so many different types that it's impossible to ever get sick of it.</h4>
		<br>
		<h3><strong>2. It fulfills your carbs craving.</strong></h3>
		<h4>After a late night of going out, there is nothing you crave more than some nice, heavy carbs. Pizza is the perfect answer.</h4>
		<br>
		<h3><strong>3. It can be a snack or a meal.</strong></h3>
		<h4>If you aren't feeling a big dinner, just pick up a slice as a quick, fulfilling snack. Mesa Pizza is my favorite pizza-by-the-slice destination.</h4>
		<br>
		<h3><strong>4. It is good when either hot or cold.</strong></h3>
		<h4>You're lying if you say that pizza for breakfast the next day isn't as good as pizza the night before for dinner. It can be eaten cold or hot and at any time of the day. It's basically the only universal food out there.</h4>
		<br>
		<h3><strong>5. It's a brilliant combo.</strong></h3>
		<h4>Bread, sauce, cheese and all of your favorite things on top? What a dynamic combination.</h3>
		<br>
		<h3><strong>6. It is a social food ...</strong></h3>
		<h4>Pizza truly does bring people together. Nothing is better then ordering a couple pizzas with a group of friends while sitting around chatting and having a casual night in.</h4>
		<img src="images/gluten.jpg" width="1200px;" height="900px;">
		<br>
		<h3><strong>7. ... and a comfort food.</strong></h3>
		<h4>It's also a great food to have surrounding you in your bed after a bad night, when you just want to shut off your phone and fill your face.</h4>
		<br>
		<h3><strong>8. It's available without having to leave your couch.</strong></h3>
		<h4>All you need to do is call it in and it will be at your door waiting for you thirty minutes later. Pizza never ignores your calls.</h4>
		<br>
		<h3><strong>9. There's no bad kind.</strong></h3>
		<h4>Even frozen pizzas deserve some kind of frozen food award. There aren't any bad types or brands of pizza, it's all delicious. Which leads me to my last point ...</h4>
		<br>
		<h3><strong>10. It's delicious.</strong></h3>
		<h4>Every bite is a tiny piece of heaven in your mouth.</h4>
